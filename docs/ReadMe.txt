                       Penny: IMDB Boards Formatting Helper
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The IMDB boards (forums) allow the user to format their text with a number of tags.
For example:
[b]This text is bold[/b]
[url]http://www.imdb.com[/url]
[red]This text will show up in red color[/red]

Adding and removing these tags by manual typing can be cumbersome.
If you spend a lot of time posting on IMDB boards, you can use this Firefox extension
to simplify formatting your text.

The extension adds a menu entry called "IMDB Boards Formatting" to the Firefox right-click menu.
It provides options to insert the formatting tags with just a click.

To insert the formatting tags:
-------------------------------
1. Select the text.
2. Right click on it.
3. From the "IMDB Boards Formatting" menu, choose the appropriate menuitem.
4. The selected text will be surrounded by the corresponding tags.


To remove the formatting tags:
-------------------------------
1. Select the text and the formatting tags surrounding it.
For example, select the entire text:  "[quote]When a suitcase just won't do![/quote]"
2. Right click on it.
3. From the "IMDB Boards Formatting" menu, choose the "Quote" menuitem.
4. The formatting tags would be automatically removed, leaving just the text: "When a suitcase just won't do!"


This extension also provides options for inserting various icons (smilies) into your posts.


PS: This extension is named after the fictional character "Penny" in "The Big Bang Theory".
The only reason I started watching this TV show.
