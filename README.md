#Penny: IMDB Boards Formatting Helper Firefox Extension
The IMDB boards (forums) allow the user to format their text with a number of tags. For example:

* [b]This text is bold[/b]
* [url]http://www.imdb.com[/url]
* [red]This text will show up in red color[/red]

Adding and removing these tags by manual typing can be cumbersome. The built-in IMDB *toolbar* does not provide any way to quickly remove the tags. If you spend a lot of time posting on IMDB boards, you can use this Firefox extension to simplify formatting your text.

The extension adds a menu entry called **IMDB Boards Formatting** to the Firefox right-click menu. It provides options to insert the formatting tags with just a click. It also provides options for inserting various icons (smilies) into your posts.

##Installation
You can install the extension by building it from source or by downloading it from the [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imdb-boards-formatting-helper/) site.

PS: This extension is named after the fictional character *Penny* in *The Big Bang Theory* TV show. She is only reason I started watching this show.
